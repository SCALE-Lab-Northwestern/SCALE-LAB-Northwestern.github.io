Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Currently, the goal of cryptography research has long been extended from the initial communication security to computational security. However, existing cryptographic schemes usually require complex computation or communication, making them difficult to deploy, thus limiting their practicality. Our team aims to design new cryptographic schemes or pragmatize existing cryptographic schemes to provide for the application and deployment of cryptographic schemes in different scenarios.

With the rapid development of science and technology, the rapid nonlinear growth of data has brought strategic opportunities for the development of big data. Among them, 2015 is the peak of big data development, and the state has announced the behavioral strategy of big data development. Because big data represents the direction of advanced productivity, it has become an unstoppable trend. However, the current situation of big data security is not very good, there are a lot of hackers through various means to obtain government, enterprise and personal privacy data, in recent years, there are many big or small privacy leakage problems. With the development of mobile Internet and cloud services, the network boundary has disappeared, and traditional defensive and detection-oriented security protection measures have become inadequate, and big data security has faced challenges. At present, the main difficulty is that it is difficult to apply for access from users in an effective way and it is difficult to detect and control the behavior of developers.

The physical layer is the cornerstone of network operation and provides physical connections for data transmission. Without the physical layer, the network becomes a tree without roots and water without a source. The most basic thing is to ensure the safe operation of the physical layer of the network.
