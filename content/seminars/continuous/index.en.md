This article introduce "well-posed" machine learning model via Continouous time limit of Machine Learning.

## Well-Posedness


## Three Continuous Limt

### Infinite-Width Limit: Mean-Field Limit of Neural Network

### Infinite-Depth Limit: ODE/SDE Limit of Neural Network

### Infinite-Data Limit: Continuous-Time Analysis of Algorithms
