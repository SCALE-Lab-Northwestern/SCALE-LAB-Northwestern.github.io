## Scaling Law

The term “scaling laws” in deep learning refers to relations between functional properties of interest (usually the test loss or some performance metric for fine-tuning tasks) and properties of the architecture or optimization process (like model size, width, or training compute). These laws can help inform the design and training of deep learning models, as well as provide insights into their underlying principles.

## Statistical Model For Physics Informed Machine Learning

Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) aims to solve equation \\(\mathcal{A}u=f\\) using observations of function \\(f\\).
