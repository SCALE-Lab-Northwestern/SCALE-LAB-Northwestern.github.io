Our team are committed to research lies in the interface of machine learning/non-parametric statistics, applied probability and numerical computation, with a primary focus on the algorithmic and theoretical foundations for more “modern” settings such as `Deep Learnig`, `Generative AI` and `AI4Science`.

## Scaling Law of Scientific Machine Learning

How large the sample size and how much computational power are needed to reach a prescribed performance level for a physic problem?

## Encoding Physics Information into a Model

## Robust Machine Learning
