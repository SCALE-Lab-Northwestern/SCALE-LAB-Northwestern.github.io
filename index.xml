These laws can help inform the design and training of deep learning models, as well as provide insights into their underlying principles.</description></item><item><title>Simulation Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning</title><link>https://scale-lab-northwestern.github.io/posts/scasml/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 09:40:28 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://scale-lab-northwestern.github.io/posts/scasml/</guid><description>TO DO</description></item></channel></rss>
